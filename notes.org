* thdr_vault notes
** General
This app is meant to serve as a store for labels and passwords that applications
and microservices can call to retrieve environment variables and secrets. There
are already a lot of services that provide this feature, but I wanted to implement
one myself.

** Todos
*** TODO Make reveal and unveal feature work in vault page
*** TODO Have to encrypt and decrypt saved data
*** TODO implement GRPC for app to get environment variables
